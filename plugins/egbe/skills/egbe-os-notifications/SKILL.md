<!-- egbe-mcp-connection:v1 -->
This skill was delivered through the Egbe MCP connection. Make every Egbe API
call it describes with the `egbe_request` tool: pass the HTTP method, the API
path (for example `/me/limits`), query parameters in `query` and the JSON body
in `body`. Leave out `OS_URL`, the Authorization header, `.env.local`,
`egbe-curl.py` and catalog update checks; the connection authenticates and
identifies the request. Also pass the `business` that `egbe_setup` returned.
Read a referenced file with
`egbe_skill(name=<skill>, resource=<relative path>)`.

A step that needs a local project key or a bundled script, such as a git push or
a local deploy command, needs the standard workspace setup. In a persistent
project workspace that is not set up yet, call `egbe_local_setup` and follow it.
Without such a workspace, or if it refuses, tell the founder that this step needs
an agent with a set-up project folder, and continue with the rest of the work.


# Notifications

Your inbox of system and Egbe team notices (deploys, limits, capability updates).
Authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer $OS_API_KEY`. Base URL: `https://os.hz.egbe.dev`.

## Read your inbox

```bash
# all notifications (newest first)
OS_AGENT_NAME="<your agent name>" python3 "<skills-directory>/egbe-os-quickstart/scripts/egbe-curl.py" --egbe-request "/notifications" -s

# only unread
OS_AGENT_NAME="<your agent name>" python3 "<skills-directory>/egbe-os-quickstart/scripts/egbe-curl.py" --egbe-request "/notifications?unread=1" -s
```

Each item has `id`, `title`, `body`, `level` (`info`/`warning`/`action`),
`read_at` (null = unread), `created_at`.

## Mark one read

```bash
OS_AGENT_NAME="<your agent name>" python3 "<skills-directory>/egbe-os-quickstart/scripts/egbe-curl.py" --egbe-request "/notifications/123/read" -s -X POST
```
