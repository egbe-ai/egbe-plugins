This skill comes with the Egbe plugin. If this project has its own installed copy
of the skill, use that copy instead. Otherwise make every Egbe API call it
describes with the Egbe connector's `egbe_request` tool: pass the HTTP method,
the API path (for example `/me/limits`), query parameters in `query` and the JSON
body in `body`. Leave out `OS_URL`, the Authorization header, `.env.local`,
`egbe-curl.py` and catalog update checks; the connection authenticates and
identifies the request. Also pass the `business` that `egbe_setup` returned.
Files this skill refers to are next to this `SKILL.md`, except any listed under
"Files downloaded on demand".

A step that needs a local project key or a bundled script, such as a git push or
a local deploy command, needs a set-up project workspace. In a persistent
project workspace that is not set up yet, set it up as the `egbe-setup` skill's
project setup describes.
Without such a workspace, or if it refuses, tell the founder that this step needs
an agent with a set-up project folder, and continue with the rest of the work.


# Apollo Lead Finder

Use this capability for a requested contact search or enrichment. It does not
choose the audience, grant permission to spend or contact people, or require an
Instantly campaign.

Read [operations](references/operations.md) for commands, input/output shapes,
limits and recovery. The four commands are:

- `search`: live Apollo preview without enrichment; consumes search quota.
- `find-leads`: search followed by enrichment.
- `enrich`: enrich a compatible people list, or resume unfinished enrichment
  from a partial Apollo result while preserving its existing leads.
- `places-leads`: Places search/details followed by guarded public website reads.

Use Node and `OS_URL` / `OS_API_KEY` (or `--env-file`). Authenticated provider
operations go through Egbe OS with Bearer auth; do not request separate Apollo
keys or bypass the gateway. Public website reads by Places are unauthenticated.

Set `--output` to a durable location in the access-controlled project repository:
the owning campaign's `egbe-docs/marketing/campaigns/instantly/<run_key>/leads.json`,
or `egbe-docs/research/<id>/work/` before a campaign exists. Keep the result's
source and completeness metadata with the contacts. Files contain personal data.

Check `meta.complete`, `stop_reason` and the unfinished inputs, not just the
number of emails. A completed zero-result search differs from an outage or quota
stop. Partial results remain usable evidence, not a claim that sourcing finished.
A provider status such as `verified` or `likely`, or a scraped `unverified`
address, does not establish current deliverability, relevance, consent or
authorization to send. These commands neither launch campaigns nor replace
downstream import verification.
